## Development

TODO

```bash
yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save
inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

Then, inside another terminal, run the example:

```bash
cd example
yarn
yarn start
```

To do a one-off build, use `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `yarn test`.
